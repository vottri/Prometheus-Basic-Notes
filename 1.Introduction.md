# Introdcution to Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source, metrics-based monitoring system designed to monitor a wide variety of targets: servers, databases, virtual machines, processes, ... (The main monitoring service is called Prometheus server while the monitoring objects are called targets).

Each target element that you want to monitor (CPU status, memory, request times, active connections, ...) is called a metric. Prometheus collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals over HTTP, stores them locally or remotely, evaluates them, displays the results, and can even trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data (metrics information is stored along with the timestamp at which it was recorded) in what is called a time series database (TSDB). Labels, which are optional key-value pairs, can also be stored along with metrics.

Metrics are useful because they provide insight into the behavior and health of your systems. Metrics are the basic values used to help you know that your system is working properly, detect changes in your system's performance, investigate resource consumption, or error rates. If someone comes up to you and says the system is slow. You will need some informations to find out what is happening with it.

# Prometheus Architecture



The Prometheus Server itself - Scrape and store metrics.

Exporters - Collect metrics from a specific third-party system and make them available for collection by Prometheus server.
 
Client Libraries - Define and expose internal metrics via HTTP endpoints.

Push Gateway - Work with short-term processes (when the service is running in a much too short time for Prometheus to be able to make requests to it to get metrics).

Alert Manager - Send notifications to the relevant recipient (Slack, mail, ...).

Web UI & Visualizations - Present collected data in a table or graph over time (Grafana are advised for actual graphs).
