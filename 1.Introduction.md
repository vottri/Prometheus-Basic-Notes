# Introdcution to Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source, metrics-based monitoring system designed to monitor a wide variety of targets: servers, databases, virtual machines, processes, ... (The main monitoring service is called Prometheus server while the monitoring objects are called targets).

Each target element that you want to monitor (CPU status, memory, request times, active connections, ...) is called a metric. Prometheus collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals over HTTP, stores them locally or remotely, evaluates them, displays the results, and can even trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data (metrics information is stored along with the timestamp at which it was recorded) in what is called a time series database (TSDB). Optional key-value pairs called labels can also be stored along with metrics.

Metrics are useful because they provide insight into the behavior and health of your systems. Metrics are the basic values used to help you know that your system is working properly, detect changes in your system's performance, investigate resource consumption, or error rates. If someone comes up to you and says the system is slow. You will need some informations to find out what is happening with it.

# Components included in the Prometheus monitoring system:

The Prometheus Server itself

Client Libraries

Push Gateway - to work with short-term processes (when the service is running in a much too short time for Prometheus to be able to make requests to it to get metrics)

Exporters - to collect metrics from a third-party service (there are millions of these types of exporters and their name is legion)

Alert Manager - A notification manager (Slack, mail, etc.)


# Way to get metrics

To get those metrics, Prometheus requires an exposed HTTP endpoint. Once an endpoint is available, Prometheus can start scraping numerical data, capture it as a time series, and store it in a local database.
