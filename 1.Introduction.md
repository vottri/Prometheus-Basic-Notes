# Introdcution to Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source, metrics-based monitoring system designed to monitor a wide variety of targets: servers, databases, virtual machines, processes, ... (the main monitoring service is called Prometheus server where the monitoring objects are called targets).

Each target element that you want to monitor (CPU status, memory, etc.) is called a metric. Prometheus collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals over HTTP, stores them locally or remotely, evaluates them, displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data (metrics information is stored along with the timestamp at which it was recorded) in what is called a time series database (TSDB). Optional key-value pairs called labels can also be stored along with metrics.

Basic Components included in the Prometheus monitoring system:

The Prometheus Server itself
Client Libraries
Push Gateway - to work with short-term processes (when the service is running in a much too short time for Prometheus to be able to make requests to it to get metrics)
Exporters - to collect metrics from a third-party service (there are millions of these types of exporters and their name is legion)
Alert Manager - A notification manager (Slack, mail, etc.)

# Metrics

Metrics represent the numeric measurements of resource usage or behavior that can be observed and collected throughout your systems. For server's health, it can be data about disk space, CPU load, memory usage, ... For a web server it might be request times or for a database it might be number of active connections or number of active queries, ...

Metrics are always associated with a certain time point , thereby forming a time series of data over time from which we can review the data at a certain point of time or over a continuing period, such as: exactly 1 hour ago or for a last 30 minutes period. 

Metrics are useful because they provide insight into the behavior and health of your systems, help you understand why your system is working in a certain way. If someone comes up to you and says the system is slow. You will need some informations to find out what is happening with it.

# Way to get metrics

To get those metrics, Prometheus requires an exposed HTTP endpoint. Once an endpoint is available, Prometheus can start scraping numerical data, capture it as a time series, and store it in a local database.
