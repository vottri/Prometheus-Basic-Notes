# Introdcution to Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. 

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data (metrics information is stored along with the timestamp at which it was recorded). Optional key-value pairs called as labels can also be stored along with metrics.

# Metrics

Metrics represent the numeric measurements of resource usage or behavior that can be observed and collected throughout your systems. For server's health, it can be data about disk space, CPU load, memory usage, ... For a web server it might be request times or for a database it might be number of active connections or number of active queries, ...

Metrics are always associated with a certain time point , thereby forming a time series of data over time from which we can review the data at a certain point of time or over a continuing period, such as: exactly 1 hour ago or for a last 30 minutes period. 

Metrics are useful because they provide insight into the behavior and health of your systems, help you understand why your system is working in a certain way. If someone comes up to you and says the system is slow. You will need some informations to find out what is happening with it.

Example: Your server has slowed down significantly in the last 3 days. Through query data from Prometheus and visualized into a chart, you can see that the server suddenly has an explosive high CPU Usage these days. You start to check the processes and detect suspicious processes running in the background. Prometheus did help you detect the problem. 

Note: Whenever you are defining the metrics for monitoring your system, you should choose them flexibly. Ask this question: What specific information will be important for you to debug if any issue occurs in your system?
