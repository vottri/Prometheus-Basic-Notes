# Introdcution to Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting tool designed to collect data about applications and systems. It also allows you to present that collected data in various forms, such as charts and graphs as well as issue real-time alerts to the relevant recipient when problems occurred.

The data about systems and applications that you want to monitor (CPU status, memory usage, request times, active connections, ...) is called a metric. Prometheus collects those metric data from monitoring objects (servers, databases, virtual machines, processes, ...) throughout your system at given intervals over HTTP and stores them in one place (locally or remotely).

In a little more detail, Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time-series data (metrics information is stored along with the timestamp at when it was recorded) in a storage called time-series database (designed for time-series data). Because metrics are associated with a certain time point, thereby forming a time series of data over time, you can review the data at a certain point of time or over a continuing period, such as: exactly 1 hour ago or for a last 30 minutes period. 

Monitoring is an important aspect of DevOps practices. In order to manage a big and complex system, you need to be able to quickly see what is happening in your systems. And through monitoring and collection of metric data, Prometheus allows you to do that. Those metrics provide insight into the behavior and health of your systems. If someone comes up to you and says the system is slow. You will need some informations to find out what is happening with it.

Example: Your server has slowed down significantly these days. Through query data from Prometheus and visualized into a chart, you can easily see that the server suddenly has an explosive high CPU Usage happening over the last 3 days. You start to check the processes and detect suspicious processes running in the background. Prometheus helped you detect the problem and the sooner a problem is detected, the sooner it can be fixed.

# Prometheus Components and Architecture

Prometheus consists of a variety of components:

• Prometheus Server - A central server that collect and store metric data.

• Exporters - Agents that expose metric data about systems and applications and make them available for collection by the Prometheus server. 

  Prometheus collects metrics mainly using a pull model. This means the Prometheus server pulls metric data from exporters — agents do not push data to the Prometheus server.
  
  For every major DevOps tool on the market, there is a specific exporter that exposes data in a format Prometheus can read. The most important of these is the Node Exporter, used to expose system metrics. 

• Client Libraries - turn your custom application into an exporter that exposes metrics in a format Prometheus can collect.

• Push Gateway - Allows pushing metrics to Prometheus for certain specific use cases. (e.g., Work with short-term processes when the service is running in a much too short time for Prometheus to be able to make requests to it to get metrics).

• Alertmanager - Sends alerts triggered by metric data to external system, such as: email, Slack, PagerDuty, ...).

• Web UI & Visualization Tools - Provide useful ways to view metric data in a chart or graph form over time. However, Grafana are advised for actual graphs.
