# Introdcution to Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source, metrics-based monitoring system designed to monitor a wide variety of targets: servers, databases, virtual machines, processes, ... (The main monitoring service is called Prometheus server while the monitoring objects are called targets).

Each target element that you want to monitor (CPU status, memory, request times, active connections, ...) is called a metric. Prometheus collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals over HTTP, stores them locally or remotely, evaluates them, displays the results in chart or graph form, and can even trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time-series data (metrics information is stored along with the timestamp at when it was recorded) in a time-series database (designed for time-series data). Those metrics provide insight into the behavior and health of your systems. They help you know that whether your system is working properly, detect changes in your system's performance, investigate resource consumption, or error rates. Because metrics are associated with a certain time point, thereby forming a time series of data over time, you can review the data at a certain point of time or over a continuing period, such as: exactly 1 hour ago or for a last 30 minutes period. 

Example: Your server has slowed down significantly these days. Through query data from Prometheus and visualized into a chart, you can easily see that the server suddenly has an explosive high CPU Usage happening over the last 3 days. You start to check the processes and detect suspicious processes running in the background. Prometheus helped you detect the problem and the sooner a problem is detected, the sooner it can be fixed.

# Prometheus Architecture



The Prometheus Server itself - Scrape and store metrics.

Exporters - Collect metrics from a specific third-party system and make them available for collection by Prometheus server.
 
Client Libraries - Define and expose internal metrics via HTTP endpoints.

Push Gateway - Work with short-term processes (when the service is running in a much too short time for Prometheus to be able to make requests to it to get metrics).

Alert Manager - Send notifications to the relevant recipient (Slack, mail, ...).

Web UI & Visualizations - Present collected data in a table or graph over time (Grafana are advised for actual graphs).
