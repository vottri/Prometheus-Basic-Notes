# Introduction

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting tool. It collects data about your systems and applications and allows you to visualize the data as well as issue alerts based on those data.

## Metrics

The data about systems and applications that you want Prometheus to collect is called a metric. Prometheus collects and stores metrics as time-series data in a time-series database (designed for time-series data). Time series data means that all the metrics are stored along with a timestamp at when it was recorded, so it can be easily queried using time ranges.

In its most basic form, a metric is made of: A metric name, The timestamp when metric data was collected, A measurement represented by a numeric value.

## Prometheus Components

Prometheus Server: Collects and stores metric data.

Prometheus Targets:

 - Exporters: Expose metric data about systems and applications for collection by the Prometheus server.

 - Client libraries: Turn your custom application into an exporter that exposes metrics in a format Prometheus can collect.

 - Pushgateway: Allows pushing metrics to Prometheus for certain specific use cases.

Alert Manager: Sends alerts triggered by collected metric data to the relevant recipient.

Visualization UI: Visualize the collected metric data in a tabular or graph form over time (Grafana is advised for actual graphs).

## Prometheus Server:

In order to monitor systems, Prometheus Server will periodically scrape them for metrics data (targets scraping).

Prometheus Server expects to retrieve metrics via HTTP calls done to certain endpoints that are defined manually in the Prometheus configuration file.

Once an endpoint is available, Prometheus Server can start scraping metrics, capture it as a time series, and store it in a local database designed for time-series data. Remote storage repositories can also be coupled with Prometheus. Once the scraped metric is stored, you can queries them using PromQL. Prometheus has its own query language, because time series data doesn't really fit well with standard SQL.

Scrapes happen regularly at given intervals; usually you would configure it to happen every 10 to 60 seconds for each target (HTTP endpoint).

## Prometheus Targets:

Prometheus uses a pull model, so you need to expose metrics from your systems and applications, so that Prometheus can go and scrape them. you can do that in several ways:

 - By ‘instrumenting‘ your application: There are client libraries in all the popular languages and runtimes. Client Libraries can turn your custom application into an exporter, meaning that your application will expose Prometheus compatible metrics on a given URL. Prometheus will define it as a target and scrape it on a given period.

 - By using of the prebuilt exporters : An exporter is a piece of software that you deploy right beside the application or system you want to obtain metrics from. It takes in requests from Prometheus, gathers the required data from the application or system it runs on, transforms them into the correct format, and finally returns them in a response to Prometheus. 
  
   Prometheus has an entire collection of exporters for existing technologies. You can for example find prebuilt exporters for Linux machine monitoring (node exporter), for very established databases (SQL exporter or MongoDB exporter) and even for HTTP load balancers (such as the HAProxy exporter).

   Example: Linux Server does not expose Prometheus-formatted metrics. That’s why Prometheus exporters, like the node exporter, exist. Node Exporter runs on a Linux Server and collects a variety of system metrics. It then exposes them to Prometheus for collection.

 - By using the Pushgateway: sometimes you have applications or jobs that do not expose metrics directly. Those applications are either not designed for it or you may have made the choice not to expose those metrics directly via your app. 
 
   For example, batch jobs (short-term processes when the service is running in a much too short time for Prometheus to be able to make requests to it to get metrics) push metric data to Pushgateway. Prometheus server then pulls metrics from Pushgateway, just like any other exporter.

## Alert Manager:

Alertmanager is an application that runs in a separate process from the Prometheus server. It is responsible for handling "alerts" sent to it by clients such as Prometheus server. "Alerts" are notifications that are triggered automatically by metric data.

Alertmanager does not create alerts or determine when alerts needs to be sent based on metric data. Prometheus handles that step and forwards the resulting alerts to Alertmanager.  

Alertmanager does the following:
 - Deduplicating alerts when multiple clients send the same alert.
 - Grouping multiple alerts together when they happen around the same time.
 - Routing alerts to the proper destination such as email, Slack, PagerDuty, ...

## Grafana:

Although Prometheus can also display collected data in its web-based user interface and lets you view the current values of metrics or have them visualized in a graph over time, the Prometheus UI itself isn't a fully featured dashboard. It is recommended that you use third-party visualization solutions like Grafana for dashboards and actual graphs. 

Grafana is an open-source tool for running analytics & monitoring your systems and applications with the help of beautiful customizable dashboards.

Grafana can connect to Prometheus as a data source, allowing you to build visualizations and dashboards to display your Prometheus metric data.

With Grafana, you can:
 - Access Prometheus data using queries.
 - Display query results using a variety of different panels (graphs, gauges, tables, etc.).
 - Arrange multiple panels into a single dashboard.

# Lab Setup

This lab was done by renting virtual machines on Microsoft Azure Cloud. You can create a free Azure account for practicing this lab.

## Create a network topology

In the Azure portal, create a new "Virtual Networks" called "myVnet".

Next, create a new "Network Secuirty Group" called "myNSG". Add the necessary inbound security rules as below.


## Add VMs to topology

Create two virtual machines installed Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS.

Check the VMs for network configuration details.

 sudo access to your system.
Working internet connection as we will download the Prometheus Linux Binary.
